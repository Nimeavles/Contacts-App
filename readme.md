# Contacts App

## This is the production branch

It has been made on Nodejs with expressjs and as for the Db, I've used Mysql.

## **To try it on your local network:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nimeavles/Contacts-App

cd Contacts-App

npm i bcrypt body-parser bootswatch ejs express express-session mysql2

npm i -D nodemon

npm run dev
```

## **Don't forget of creating the database:**

_Copy SQL Code from 'db/db.sql'_

**Also, change the database creadentials on 'config/database.js'**
